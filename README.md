After a month of idleness I continue learning Java. To remember all my knowledge about this lang i decided to write some kind of project. 
It became a CLI Hangman Game. However i didn't write another easy program because it's too boring. That's why i added some stuff like main-menu and settings-menu in this game with statistic.
In the settings menu you can see/clear statistic with different parameters like "count of games" or "count of wrong guesses". Also you can set a limit of maximum wrong answers. 
All data from statistic saving into .txt file
